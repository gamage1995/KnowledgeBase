## React Js Potential Interview Questions

#### What are the features of React?

- JSX: JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.
- Components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. It splits the user interface into independent, reusable parts that can be processed separately.
- Virtual DOM: React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object changes, virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects.
- One-way data-binding: Reactâ€™s one-way data binding keeps everything modular and fast. A unidirectional data flow means that when designing a React app, you often nest child components within parent components.
- High performance: React updates only those components that have changed, rather than updating all the components at once. This results in much faster web applications.

#### State and Lifecycle

- How to pass a function to a child component?
- How components are refreshed ( life cycle )
- How to handle componentDidUpdate without infinite loop
- How are class components rendered? Please explain step wise
- What are the different phases of react lifecycle
- Implementation of state ( with constructor and without )
- Update a state ( asynchronous )
- how to handle a event that should hapen after state update
- Why we don't update by directly assigning a value
- What are the two methods to update state

- What is the need of using keys in a list
- Is it okay to use index as a key?
- Why other component does not have key attribute?

#### Lifting State Up

- What do you mean by state uplifting?
- How can we omit props drilling?

#### Redux and components of redux

- Redux's intent can be summarized in three principles
  - Global app state is kept in a single store
  - The store state is read-only to the rest of the app
  - Reducer functions are used to update the state in response to actions
- Redux uses a "one-way data flow" app structure
  - State describes the condition of the app at a point in time, and UI renders based on that state
  - When something happens in the app:
  - The UI dispatches an action
  - The store runs the reducers, and the state is updated based on what occurred
  - The store notifies the UI that the state has changed
  - The UI re-renders based on the new state
- use case of Redux thunk
  - One of the main use cases for this middleware is for handling actions that might not be synchronous, for example, using axios to send a GET request. Redux Thunk allows us to dispatch those actions asynchronously and resolve each promise that gets returned.
